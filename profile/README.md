# About
<h6>-By My Phung</h6>
Menumizer is an app for you if you feel like you spend way too much time and effort figuring out what you want to eat when you go out. The idea for Menumizer happened naturally; I thought of it when I was at a restaurant!<br/><br/> 

Last Christmas I celebrated my family renunion at a restaurant, and the menu we were each given was ONLY two pages, but there must have been at least 20 amazing options.<br/>
For 5-10 minutes I was searching the food's picture up on Google, and asking my cousins what they were going to eat so that I could get a better idea of what's good. At this point I recognized that I have this mild inconvenience every time I go to a restaurant<br/>
So... what if there was an app that would allow me to take a picture of my menu and show me what I should pick and why?<br/><br/>

I don't have much of an impressive background from a developer's standpoint. I don't know much about AI besides being a serial ChatGPT user, and I have never touched mobile development. However, no one's made a solution for this, and I know many people who experience this inconvenience. So... let's do it!  üòÅ
