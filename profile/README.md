# About
<h6>-By My Phung</h6>
Menumizer is an app for you if you feel like you spend way too much time and effort figuring out what you want to eat when you go out. The idea for Menumizer happened naturally; I thought of it when I was at a restaurant!<br/><br/> 

Last Christmas I celebrated my family renunion at a restaurant. The menu we were each given was ONLY two pages, but there must have been at least 20 amazing options!<br/>
I spent 5-10 minutes searching the options up on Google and asking my cousins what they were going to eat, so that I could be assured I wouldn't regret not choosing something else. At this point I recognized that I continue to have this mild inconvenience every time I go to a restaurant, and I decided I ought to do something about it.<br/>
So... what if there was an app that would allow me to take a picture of my menu and show me what I should pick and why?<br/><br/>

I knew nothing about AI. I knew nothing about mobile development. No one's made a solution, but I know many people experience this inconvenience. Now here we are!
